            Terms of Service
          </h3>
          <p>
            Effective date: June 5th 2017
          </p>
          <p>
            Welcome to MyBandSource. Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website and services. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at hello@mybandsource.com or mailing address (insert mailing address here).
          </p>
          <p>
            These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and MyBandSource, LLC. (“MyBandSource,” “we” and “us”). You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services. Your using the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <h6>
            Will these Terms ever change?
          </h6>
          <p>
            We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the mybandsource.com website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.
          </p>
          <h6>

          </p>
          <p>
            A violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your right to use or access the Services.
          </p>
          <h6>
            What are my rights in MyBandSource?
          </h6>
          <p>
            The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Services, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, User Generated Content, and so forth (all of the foregoing, the “Content”) are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws. You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including MyBandSource’s) rights.
          </p>
          <p>
            You understand that MyBandSource owns the Services. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), create derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply – they do!
          </p>
          <h6>
            Do I have to grant any licenses to MyBandSource or to other users?
          </h6>
          <p>
            Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your “User Generated Content.” User Generated Content is viewable by other users. In order to display your User Generated Content on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in the User Generated Content. Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our Privacy Policy to the extent they relate to User Generated Content are also your personally-identifiable information.
          </p>
          <p>
            For all User Generated Content, you hereby grant MyBandSource a license to translate, modify (for technical purposes, for example making sure your content is viewable on an iPhone as well as a computer) and reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such User Generated Content, in each case to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more detail below. This is a license only – your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you share a User Generated Content publicly on the Services and/or in a manner that more than just you or certain specified users can view, or if you provide us (in a direct email or otherwise) with any feedback, suggestions, improvements, enhancements, and/or feature requests relating to the Services] (each of the foregoing, a “User Generated Content”), then you grant MyBandSource the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your User Generated Content for the purpose of making that User Generated Content accessible to all MyBandSource users and providing the Services necessary to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that User Generated Content in connection with the Services and/or otherwise in connection with MyBandSource’s business for any purpose, provided that MyBandSource will try to notify you if it uses your User Generated Content for any reason other than displaying it on the Services. Also, you grant all other users of the Services a license to access that User Generated Content, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, you understand and agree that MyBandSource, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User Generated Content to conform and adapt those User Generated Content to the technical requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or media, and the foregoing licenses include the rights to do so.
          </p>
          <h6>
            What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright?
          </h6>
          <p>
            You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”), as it relates to online service providers, like MyBandSource, being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someone’s copyright. We respect others’ intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers; to review our complete Copyright Dispute Policy and learn how to report potentially infringing content, click here.
          </p>
          <h6>
            Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?
          </h6>
          <p>
            Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. We can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. You will keep all your registration information accurate and current. You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by MyBandSource. When you access third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that MyBandSource is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or utilize.
          </p>
          <p>
            MyBandSource has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services. In addition, MyBandSource will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party site or service. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website or service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that MyBandSource shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you agree that MyBandSource is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release MyBandSource, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor."
          </p>
          <h6>
            Will MyBandSource ever change the Services?
          </h6>
          <p>
            We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.
          </p>
          <h6>
            Does MyBandSource cost anything?
          </h6>
          <p>
            The MyBandSource Services are currently free, but we reserve the right to charge for certain or all Services in the future. We will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services.
          </p>
          <h6>
            What if I want to stop using MyBandSource?
          </h6>
          <p>
            You’re free to do that at any time, by contacting us at hello@mybandsource.com; please refer to our Privacy Policy, as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services. MyBandSource is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms. MyBandSource has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account. We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important User Generated Content you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone’s safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of MyBandSource.
          </p>
          <p>
            Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.
          </p>
          <h6>
            What else do I need to know?
          </h6>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Limitation of Liability. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL MYBANDSOURCE (OR ITS LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR (B) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF (I) $100 OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO MYBANDSOURCE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM, OR (III) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL.

          </p>
          <p>

In the event of such a claim, suit, or action (“Claim”), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).
          </p>
          <p>
            Assignment. You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without MyBandSource’s prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.
